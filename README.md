# TamperMonkeyScripts
Some more or less useful Scripts I needed as a Hobby Project
Most is pretty simple hacky code so might break sooner or later

## ValorantDropAutomator

Used with Tampermonkey and compatible with [Firefox Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) to create multiple instances in one browser. Twitch doesn't seem to care.


### Features:
- automates finding a valid stream
- reloads stream on timeout or another error and every 10 minutes
- sets stream quality to 160p and disables low latency
- automatically collects channel points
- handles most warnings
- disables itself while login/registration form is open
